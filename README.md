# TA7642 Radio

A very tiny pocket AM radio powered by a 1.5 volt battery.

At the core of the circuit is the TA7642 AM demodulator and amplifier IC. The coil and the capacitor form a tank circuit that selects
the desired frequency to tune into and the signal is demodulated and amplified in the IC. After that, Q1 is behaves as a simple amplifier
to raise the level of the audio signal so that it can be heard through headphones or earbuds.

I made this as a kit so there is documentation and instructions to make it.

I created this circuit and pcb in 2021 when I was in 5th grade as a project to learn about radios, electronics, and PCB design.
